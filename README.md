# SkinCure

a small java project that helps you compare skincare products based on:
- **brand**
- **product type** (cleanser, moisturizer, etc.)
- **rating**
- **quantity**
- **skin type compatibility**

## how it works
1. user enters their skin type (oily, dry, sensitive, combination, etc.).
2. input details for two skincare products.
3. program compares the products:
   - higher rating is preferred
   - product must match the userâ€™s skin type
   - only products of the same type can be compared

## tech stack
- java (core oop concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, comparison logic)
- git + github for version control

## usage
compile and run:
```bash
javac Skincare.java
java Main
